        <p class="speech">Present._--PRINCE PETROVITCH, BARON RAFF, MARQUIS DE POIVRARD, COUNT

        <h6 class="name BARONRAFF"><b>BARON RAFF.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> The devil!</p><br>

        <h6 class="name CZAR"><b>CZAR.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> No, Baron, the CZAR. Traitors! There would be no bad kings in the
            world if there were no bad ministers like you. It is men such as you who
            wreck mighty empires on the rock of their own greatness. Our mother,
            Russia, hath no need of such unnatural sons. You can make no atonement
            now; it is too late for that. The grave cannot give back your dead, nor
            the gibbet your martyrs, but I shall be more merciful to you. I give you
            your lives! That is the curse I would lay on you. But if there is a man
            of you found in Moscow by to-morrow night your heads will be off your
            shoulders.</p>
        </p><br>

        <h6 class="name BARONRAFF"><b>BARON RAFF.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> You remind us wonderfully, Sire, of your Imperial father.</p><br>

        <h6 class="name CZAR"><b>CZAR.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> I banish you all from Russia. Your estates are confiscated to the
            people. You may carry your titles with you. Reforms in Russia, Baron,
            always end in a farce. You will have a good opportunity, Prince
            Petrovitch, of practising self-denial, that excellent virtue! that
            excellent virtue! So, Baron, you think a Parliament in Russia would be
            merely a place for brawling. Well, I will see that the reports of each
            session are sent to you regularly.</p><br>

        <h6 class="name BARONRAFF"><b>BARON RAFF.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> Sire, you are adding another horror to exile.</p><br>

        <h6 class="name CZAR"><b>CZAR.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> But you will have such time for literature now. You forget you are
            diplomatists. Men of thought should have nothing to do with action.</p><br>

        PRINCE PETRO. Sire, we did but jest.</p><br>

        <h6 class="name CZAR"><b>CZAR.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> Then I banish you for your bad jokes. Bon voyage, Messieurs.[4] If
            you value your lives you will catch the first train for Paris. </p>

        <P class="stage-direction">(_Exeunt MINISTERS._) </p>

        <p class="speech">Russia is well rid of such men as these. They are the
            jackals that follow in the lion's track. [5]They have no courage
            themselves, except to pillage and rob.[5] But for these men and for
            Prince Paul my father would have been a good king, would not have died
            so horribly as he did die. How strange it is, the most real parts of
            one's life always seem to be a dream! The council, the fearful law which
            was to kill the people, the arrest, the cry in the courtyard, the
            pistol-shot, my father's bloody hands, and then the crown! One can live
            for years sometimes, without living at all, and then all life comes
            crowding into a single hour. I had no time to think. Before my father's
            hideous shriek of death had died in my ears I found this crown on my
            head, the purple robe around me, and heard myself called a king. I would
            have given it up all then; it seemed nothing to me then; but now, can I
            give it up now? Well, Colonel, well? </p>

        <P class="stage-direction">(_Enter COLONEL OF THE GUARD._)</p><br>

        <h6 class="name COLONEL"><b>COLONEL.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> What password does your Imperial Majesty desire should be given to-night?</p><br>

        <h6 class="name CZAR"><b>CZAR.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> Password?</p><br>

        <h6 class="name COLONEL"><b>COLONEL.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> [6]For the cordon of[6] guards, Sire, on night duty around the
            palace.</p><br>

        <h6 class="name CZAR"><b>CZAR.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> You can dismiss them. I have no need of them.</p>
        <P class="stage-direction">(_Exit COLONEL._)</p>
        <P class="stage-direction">(_Goes to the crown lying on the table._) </p>
        <p class="speech">What subtle potency lies
            hidden in this gaudy bauble, the crown,[7] that makes one feel like a
            god when one wears it? To hold in one's hand this little fiery coloured
            world, to reach out one's arm to earth's uttermost limit, to girdle the
            seas with one's hosts; this is to wear a crown! to wear a crown! The
            meanest serf in Russia who is loved is better crowned than I. How love
            outweighs the balance! How poor appears the widest empire of this
            golden world when matched with love! Pent up in this palace, with spies
            dogging every step, I have heard nothing of her; I have not seen her
            once since that fearful hour three days ago, when I found myself
            suddenly the Czar of this wide waste, Russia. Oh, could I see her for a
            moment; tell her now the secret of my life I have never dared utter
            before; tell her why I wear this crown, when I have sworn eternal war
            against all crowned men! There was a meeting to-night. I received my
            summons by an unknown hand; but how could I go? I who have broken my
            oath! who have broken my oath!</p><br>

        <P class="stage-direction">(_Enter PAGE._)</p><br>

        <h6 class="name PAGE"><b>PAGE.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> It is after eleven, Sire. Shall I take the first watch in your
            room to-night?</p><br>

        <h6 class="name CZAR"><b>CZAR.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> Why should you watch me, boy? The stars are my best sentinels.</p><br>

        <h6 class="name PAGE"><b>PAGE.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> It was your Imperial father's wish, Sire, never to be left alone
            while he slept.</p><br>

        <h6 class="name CZAR"><b>CZAR.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> My father was troubled with bad dreams. Go, get to your bed, boy;
            it is nigh on midnight, and these late hours will spoil those red
            cheeks. </p>
        <P class="stage-direction">(_PAGE tries to kiss his hand._)</p>
        <p class="speech"> Nay, nay; we have played
            together too often as children for that. Oh, to breathe the same air as
            her, and not to see her! the light seems to have gone from my life, the
            sun vanished from my day.</p><br>

        <h6 class="name PAGE"><b>PAGE.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> Sire,--Alexis,--let me stay with[8] you to-night! There is some
            danger over you; I feel there is.</p><br>

        <h6 class="name CZAR"><b>CZAR.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> What should I fear? I have banished all my enemies from Russia.
            Set the brazier here, by me; it is very cold, and I would sit by it for
            a time. Go, boy, go; I have much to think about to-night. </p>

        <p class="speech"> (_Goes to back of stage, draws aside curtain. View of Moscow by moonlight._) </p>

        <p class="speech">The snow has fallen heavily since sunset. How white and cold my city looks under
            this pale moon! And yet, what hot and fiery hearts beat in this icy
            Russia, for all its frost and snow! Oh, to see her for a moment; to tell
            her all; to tell her why I am a king! But she does not doubt me; she
            said she would trust in me. Though I have broken my oath, she will have
            trust. It is very cold. Where is my cloak? I shall sleep for an hour.
            Then I have ordered my sledge, and, though I die for it, I shall see
            Vera to-night. Did I not bid thee go, boy? What! must I play the tyrant
            so soon? Go, go! I cannot live without seeing her. My horses will be
            here in an hour; one hour between me and love! How heavy this charcoal
            fire smells. </p>
        <P class="stage-direction">(_Exit the PAGE. Lies down on a couch beside brazier._)</p><br>

        <P class="stage-direction">(_Enter VERA in a black cloak._)</p><br>

        <h6 class="name VERA"><b>VERA.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> Asleep! God, thou art good! Who shall deliver him from my hands
            now? [9]This is he! The democrat who would make himself a king, the
            republican who hath worn a crown, the traitor who hath lied to us.
            Michael was right. He loved not the people. He loved me not.[9] </p>
        <P class="stage-direction">(_Bends over him._) </p>
        <p class="speech">Oh, why should such deadly poison lie in such sweet lips?
            Was there not gold enough in his hair before, that he should tarnish it
            with this crown? But my day has come now; the day of the people, of
            liberty, has come! Your day, my brother, has come! Though I have
            strangled whatever nature is in me, I did not think it had been so easy
            to kill. One blow and it is over, and I can wash my hands in water
            afterwards, I can wash my hands afterwards. Come, I shall save Russia. I
            have sworn it. </p>
        <P class="stage-direction">(_Raises dagger to strike._)</p><br>

        <p class="speech"> CZAR (_staring up, seizes her by both hands_).</p>
        <p class="speech"> Vera, you here! My dream
            was no dream at all. Why have you left me three days alone, when I most
            needed you? O God, you think I am a traitor, a liar, a king? I am, for
            love of you. Vera, it was for you I broke my oath and wear my father's
            crown. I would lay at your feet this mighty Russia, which you and I
            have loved so well; would give you this earth as a footstool! set this
            crown on your head. The people will love us. We will rule them by love,
            as a father rules his children. There shall be liberty in Russia for
            every man to think as his heart bids him; liberty for men to speak as
            they think. I have banished the wolves that preyed on us; I have brought
            back your brother from Siberia; I have opened the blackened jaws of the
            mine. The courier is already on his way; within a week Dmitri and all
            those with him will be back in their own land. The people shall be
            free--are free now--and you and I, Emperor and Empress of this mighty
            realm, will walk among them openly, in love. When they gave me this
            crown first, I would have flung it back to them, had it not been for
            you, VERA. O God! It is men's custom in Russia to bring gifts to those
            they love. I said, I will bring to the woman I love a people, an empire,
            a world! Vera, it is for you, for you alone, I kept this crown; for you
            alone I am a king. Oh, I have loved you better than my oath! Why will
            you not speak to me? You love me not! You love me not! You have come to
            warn me of some plot against my life. What is life worth to me without
            you? </p>

        <p class="speech"> Nay, you are safe here. It wants five hours still of dawn.

        <p class="speech"> I am no king now. I am only a boy who has
            loved you better than his honour, better than his oath. For love of the
            people I would have been a patriot. For love of you I have been a
            traitor. Let us go forth together, we will live amongst the common
            people. I am no king. I will toil for you like the peasant or the serf.
            Oh, love me a little too! </p>
