        <p class="speech"> The devil!</p><br>

        <h6 class="name CZAR"><b>CZAR.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> No, Baron, the CZAR. Traitors! There would be no bad kings in the
            world if there were no bad ministers like you. It is men such as you who
            wreck mighty empires on the rock of their own greatness. Our mother,
            Russia, hath no need of such unnatural sons. You can make no atonement
            now; it is too late for that. The grave cannot give back your dead, nor
            the gibbet your martyrs, but I shall be more merciful to you. I give you
            your lives! That is the curse I would lay on you. But if there is a man
            of you found in Moscow by to-morrow night your heads will be off your
            shoulders.</p>
        </p><br>

        <h6 class="name BARONRAFF"><b>BARON RAFF.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> You remind us wonderfully, Sire, of your Imperial father.</p><br>

        <h6 class="name CZAR"><b>CZAR.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> I banish you all from Russia. Your estates are confiscated to the
            people. You may carry your titles with you. Reforms in Russia, Baron,
            always end in a farce. You will have a good opportunity, Prince
            Petrovitch, of practising self-denial, that excellent virtue! that
            excellent virtue! So, Baron, you think a Parliament in Russia would be
            merely a place for brawling. Well, I will see that the reports of each
            session are sent to you regularly.</p><br>

        <h6 class="name BARONRAFF"><b>BARON RAFF.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> Sire, you are adding another horror to exile.</p><br>

        <h6 class="name CZAR"><b>CZAR.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> But you will have such time for literature now. You forget you are
            diplomatists. Men of thought should have nothing to do with action.</p><br>

        PRINCE PETRO. Sire, we did but jest.</p><br>

        <h6 class="name CZAR"><b>CZAR.</b></h6>
        <p class="speech"> Then I banish you for your bad jokes. Bon voyage, Messieurs.[4] If
            you value your lives you will catch the first train for Paris. </p>

        <P class="stage-direction">(_Exeunt MINISTERS._) </p>

        <p class="speech">Russia is well rid of such men as these. They are the
            jackals that follow in the lion's track. [5]They have no courage
            themselves, except to pillage and rob.[5] But for these men and for
            Prince Paul my father would have been a good king, would not have died
            so horribly as he did die. How strange it is, the most real parts of
            one's life always seem to be a dream! The council, the fearful law which
            was to kill the people, the arrest, the cry in the courtyard, the
            pistol-shot, my father's bloody hands, and then the crown! One can live
            for years sometimes, without living at all, and then all life comes
            crowding into a single hour. I had no time to think. Before my father's
            hideous shriek of death had died in my ears I found this crown on my
            head, the purple robe around me, and heard myself called a king. I would
            have given it up all then; it seemed nothing to me then; but now, can I
            give it up now? Well, Colonel, well? </p>
